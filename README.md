# RGB_to_picture

## Overview
This Java program is designed to read from an input data file, `image.dat`, containing RGB color values for each pixel of an image, and create an RGB image file, `output.png`, based on the provided width and height. It employs bitwise shifting and masking operations to calculate the RGB integer value for each pixel, combining red, green, and blue color components into a single integer value.
